## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A calming blue (#5DADE2) to promote trust and reliability. This hue is suitable for the app because it resonates well with the themes of assistance and problem-solving. This choice also leans into common color conventions of successful tech companies.
- Background color: A very light, desaturated blue (#EBF5FB) creates a clean, uncluttered backdrop for the app's features. Because its saturation is around 20%, the visual prominence of this hue is subdued.
- Accent color: A soft green (#A3E4D7), approximately 30 degrees from the primary on the color wheel, to signal actions and updates.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif font, which provides a balance of modernity and readability.
- Use simple, clear icons for ticket status, categories, and actions to ensure ease of use.
- Design a clean and intuitive layout with a clear separation between user tickets, agent queues, and admin settings.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and animations for a smoother user experience when updating ticket statuses or loading new content.
